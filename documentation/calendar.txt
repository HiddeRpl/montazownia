Libraries needed: jQuery, Momement.js, fullcalendar.js, fullcalendar.css, gcal.js.

Google Calendar API key is needed. Get from url
"https://console.developers.google.com/apis/credentials?project=montazownia-calendar-api&authuser=3"
API key's restrictions need to be set for websites and specified urls.

All the calendars' IDs are needed. Get from google calendar site, choose a calendar, go to settings, chapter
Integrating calendar and at the top there is calendar ID.

To implement a calendar firstly we need a DOM element like a <div> at which we will target and inject all the data.
In present project at calendar template there is a <div> with id="calendar". Next, in proper javascript file got to
invoke method fullCalendar(), in which we pass object with properties:
    a) googleCalendarApiKey - API key
    b) header - set up of header like position of buttons
    c) height - widget's height in pixels
    d) timeFormat - time format, can be am/pm or 24h with optional minutes
    e) firstDay - which day is the first day of the week, 0 for sunday
    f) dayNames - full day names
    g) dayNamesShort - shortened day names
    h) displayEventEnd - boolean, if calendar displays event's end
    i) eventColor - specify color of events
    j) eventSources - array of objects, single object for single calendar, we need to pass here google calendar id

Next, there is a function which push inner text to the DOM element. Timeout because of waiting for calendar to render.
Need to be improved, no event listener after changing the month (ajax call).
